CustomizableClipMount
=====================

3D printable Customizable Clip Mount is developed to be parametrically generated to mount various objects and easily remove them from the mounts. It is built in OpenScan for simple modifications.

## Instructions
Download CustomizableClipMount.scad and edit off-line or [edit it directly online](http://openjscad.org/#https://raw.github.com/IRNAS/CustomizableClipMount/master/CustomizableClipMount.scad). Measure the width and height of the object you wish to mount, customize the clip width, mounting options and other parameters, defaults should be suitable for most functions.
